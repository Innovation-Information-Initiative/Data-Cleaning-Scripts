# I3 Shared Data Cleaning Scripts

This is shared repository for data cleaning scripts, with a focus on innovation-related data. If you have some code you'd like to submit, please read our [contribution guidelines](./contributing.md), and make a pull request using a [pull request template](./docs/pull_request_template). 

Welcome scripts include general-purpose tools for scraping, deduplication, and format munging; mapping between common schemas; entity resolution and disambiguation, and any scripts that you might include with data publications to facilitate replication.  The latter could include scripts that general useful auxiliary files referenced in common analyses.

## Using the code

Each repository listed here should be documented to a standard that will let you know how and on what to run it. If you have problems with code files that are hosted in this repository directly, please open a github issue, or a pull request if you correct the issue and would like to amend the documentation. If you're having trouble with an external repository that is linked to by a URL, then raise an issue in that repository.
