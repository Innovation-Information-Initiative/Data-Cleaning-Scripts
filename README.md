# I3 Shared Data Processing Scripts

This is shared repository for data processing scripts, with a focus on innovation-related data. 'Processing' in this context could refer to a number of different operations, including (but not limited to):

* normalisation
* disambiguation and entity reconciliation
* web scraping
* parsing web-scraped data
* transformation/merging different datasets together
* standardising datasets
* deduplication 

If you have some code you'd like to submit, please read our [contribution guidelines](./contributing.md), and make a pull request using a [pull request template](./docs/pull_request_template).

## Using code from this repository

Each separate folder here contains a repository of data processing scripts (or, more commonly a link to one plus a description), contributed by a member of the community. Each repository listed here should be documented to a standard that will let you know how and on what to run it. If you have problems with code files that are hosted in this repository directly, please open a github issue, or a pull request if you correct the issue and would like to amend the documentation. If you're having trouble with an external repository that is linked to by a URL, then raise an issue in that repository.
