# Pull request template

choose your adventure (copy/paste this into your PR message, along with any other description):

## I'm linking an existing repository

- [ ] I have a README inside a folder
- [ ] The README contains a link to the scripts, the relevant datasets, author information, and a short description

## I'm uploading a set of scripts

- [ ] I have a README inside a folder, along with the scripts, that gives a *thorough* description of how to run the code, and on what (try this [Template README](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/blob/releases/README.md))
- [ ] These scripts are not already hosted in a GitHub repository (if they are, you should link that!)

## I'm amending an existing repository

- [ ] my PR contains a thorough description of the change I am proposing, unless it is self-evident (e.g. the simple addition of information)
